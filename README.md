# 6-axis robotic arm development project in a smart food engineering lab (SFLAB)

The arm's joints use brush motors from CUBEMARS. [[https://www.cubemars.com/]] <br/>
As of 2024-12-17, joints 1 and 2 are using the AK70 model, while joints 3, 4, 5, and 6 are using the AK60 model. <br/>
The communication method between the upper computer and the motor uses CAN communication, and a USB to CAN analogizer is used for control and reading.<br/>
